COMMONWEALTH CONECTIONS MUSIC FEATURE: MALTA  Malta's history reads like a Dan Brown novel and the music that has been recorded for this week's feature is infused with Malta's wonderfully diverse historical influences. Musician and composer, Ruben Zahra, takes us on a guided tour of traditional Maltese instruments that span the centuries: from the iz-Zummara, a Maltese reed flute fashioned by children as a toy, to the impressive Maltese bagpipe or iz-Zaqq. Ruben's passion for these instruments, the music and the skills needed to play is helping to prevent their extinction, as happened with the Maltese Lira. This is the world's first studio recording of the Maltese Lira which was lost some 200 years ago but recreated using lithographs and paintings. The tradition of working-class folk song is also being kept alive by the Maltese people in the wine bars of Zejtun. The 'Spirtu Pront' genre of folk song requires singers to verbally duel with improvised lyrics and it has been recorded live in the Ta' Ganna bar with six singers competing for their pride and superiority. They are accompanied by local musicians playing the unusual, horned, Maltese guitar.  HERITAGE FEATURE: THE GAMBIA  The Gambia is a relatively small slice of land in West Africa on the north and south shores of the river Gambia, and surrounded by Senegal. This week's Commonwealth athlete Suwaibou Sanneh currently lives away from his home town of Brikama studying in the States but he carries the country's music with him as he prepares for the 100 metres sprint, an event for which he holds the Gambian national record. A semi-finalist at the London Olympics, he aims to do even better at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Music from Jaliba Kuyateh and The Kumareh Band  SESSION: LA CHIVA GANTIVA La Chiva Gantiva are a group of young Colombian musicians who met in Brussels. Fuelled with a desire to get back to their roots, they started to combine Colombian rhythms with rock, afrobeat and funk. Their new album 'Vivo' is out now on Crammed Discs. We catch them as they are about to embark on their UK tour.|BBC Radio 3|Music,World,Folk|http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/programmeimages/p01ymwc1/b042bqrs_150_84.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b042bqrs.html|||

Also a session with Simon Thacker's multicultural Indian-Western group Svara-Kanti, and a selection of new World Music releases.  COMMONWEALTH CONNECTIONS FEATURE / Uganda - both sides of the Nile Across the source of the Nile at Jinja and eastwards towards the Kenyan border lies a remote and rural Busogan village with music both from the Busoga royal courts and of the people. The last surviving musicians of the Royal courts are the Xylophone players, playing a giant wooden xylophone built across a pit in the ground for resonance. This impromptu concert at the village also features a rare opportunity to hear the gourd trumpets of Busoga, also a part of the royal music who have been named by UNESCO on the list of Important Cultural Heritages in need of urgent safeguarding. Meanwhile and by contrast in the leafy campus of Kyambogo University in Kampala, we meet one of the two Ennanga (Bow harp) players of Buganda, who learned from court players at the Buganda Royal Palace. This beautiful instrument was played pointing towards the King and the player was his confidante and personal advisor, relating in stories, all the worries and concerns of his people.  HERITAGE TRACK - ST KITTS AND NEVIS Athlete Jason Rogers (100m), living and training in Canada, chooses as his Heritage Track an example of the soca music so popular back home in the Caribbean islands of St Kitts and Nevis. Unstoppable Force by King Konris is deeply rooted in that country and speaks of the pride, dedication and energy of the people, something Jason finds inspiring as he looks forward to representing St Kitts and Nevis at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in a few weeks' time.  SESSION - Simon Thacker's group Svara-Kanti Simon Thacker and his group Svara-Kanti bring a mix of original pieces as well as arrangements to our studio, in this special multicultural experiment.

Commonwealth Connections - Feature: Malaysia In the capital of Malaysia's southernmost state of Johor, traditional Malay Ghazal and Zapin dance music is popular despite the country's race to modernity. We hear from On Jaafar and Shafie Bin Ahmad how Zapin music and dance arrived with the Arab Missionaries and that the tradition of Ghazal came from Persia; graduating from royal palace performances to the local community.  Commonwealth Connections - Heritage Track: Mozambique Mozambique is something of an anomaly in terms of Commonwealth membership. It only became a member in 1995 and was never under British control. Instead the country was ruled by Portugal from 1505 until independence in 1975. As a result Portuguese remains the official language and strong ties remain between Mozambique and Portugal. Swimmer Jessica Teixeira Vieira is part of that story, having been raised on the island and has chosen to represent them at events such as the Olympics. Her chosen piece of music is a Marrabenta a musical form typical of Mozambique, and the song is A Nkama wa hi Siya sung by Mingas.

At the outbreak of war, Elgar was noted for being more concerned about his beloved horses, than for any soldiers fighting. Little did anyone know how many horses or people would die in this conflict, which lasted more than the predicted three months. Elgar did do his bit though, joining the Special Reserve, conducting charity concerts to raise much needed funds, and composing the odd bit of jingoistic music to rally the people. It is the Great War period back at home in Great Britain, with Zeppelin raids, German cruisers shelling Whitby and Scarborough, to xenophobic riots in London, which Donald Macleod explores tracing how these events affected the life and music of Sir Edward Elgar.   1914, and in the age of Empire and British supremacy at sea, it was the Edwardian Golden Summer. Few people realised that war was looming, and commissions were coming in for Elgar, such as from the Sons of Clergy Festival at St. Paul's Cathedral, for which he composed his anthem Give unto the Lord. Soon, with motor vehicles requisitioned, and the unmistakable increase of men in khaki, the Great War had begun. Elgar soon received his first war commission in aid of the Belgian Fund, writing a work for narrator and orchestra, Carillon. But many of Elgar's most fierce supporters were German, including Hans Richter, to whom he dedicated his Three Bavarian Dances.|BBC Radio 3|Music,Classical|http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/programmeimages/p0218b0n/b016vn00_640_360.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016vn00.html|1|1|

Commonwealth Connections - Feature: Singapore Singapore is home to a very senior group of 'waijiang' musicians originating from Chaozhou in southern China. Their waijiang style of playing was popular in pre-cultural revolutionary China but is now extinct on the mainland. Yet in their small shop house in the Geylang neighbourhood these senior gentlemen still take pride in performing pieces such as 'Little Peach Red' and 'Pipa verse'. Not far away in Chinatown a group of young students from the Siong Leng Musical Association practice Nanyin or 'southern pipes music' - the traditional wooden flute and voice reminisce wistfully of home.  Commonwealth Connections - Heritage Feature Formerly known as the Ellice Islands, Tuvalu is a Pacific island nation situated between Hawaii and Australia. Its population of just 11,200 means it the third-least populous sovereign state in the world, and in terms of land mass at ten square miles it's the fourth-smallest country in the world. If you stand in the middle of the main island you can see the Pacific Ocean in every direction. Tuvalu first took part in the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and since then has steadily increased its participation. But Tuvalu weightlifter Lapua Lapua isn't just an Olympian - he's a bit of a singer and guitarist too, and gave us a taste of the Pacific. The song is "Toku nukupele funafuti" by Tamaika Kofe.  Session: Phillip Henry and Hannah Martin Phillip Henry, one of the UK's top slide guitar player and master of the Dobro, and Hannah Martin, singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, join us live in the studio for an exclusive session before they rush off to Glastonbury.|BBC Radio 3|Music,World,Folk|http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/programmeimages/p021jclc/b047bshd_640_360.jpg||http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b047bshd.html|||
